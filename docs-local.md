# Local Workflow

Pre-requisites:
* `node` 18.x and `npm` installed

## Install and Run the App

Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Then you can run it:
```
npm start
```

If the log looks like this it's working:

```
> demo-node@1.0.0 start
> node index.js

demo-node listening on port 3000
```

## Send Test Transactions

This will send calls port 3000 which is the default. These commands are expected to succeed, if they fail your environment may be misconfigured.

```
export PORT=3000
curl http://localhost:$PORT/
curl http://localhost:$PORT/nasa
curl http://localhost:$PORT/events
curl http://localhost:$PORT/bin
```

## Capture 

You need a Speedscale account and `speedctl` installed. If you already installed, make sure you are running the latest version:

```
speedctl update
```

And you will need certificates on your machine, so make sure they are created with this command:

```
speedctl create certs -o ~/.speedscale/certs
```

To quickly capture on your own local machine, you can capture the inbound and outbound traffic using `speedctl` with this command:

```
speedctl capture demo-node 3000
```

Now you need to configure your application to use the proxy, this is from the [Speedscale Proxy Docs](https://docs.speedscale.com/setup/sidecar/proxy-modes/#configuring-your-application-proxy-server).

```
export GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTP_PROXY='http://127.0.0.1:4140'
export GLOBAL_AGENT_HTTPS_PROXY='http://127.0.0.1:4140'
export GLOBAL_AGENT_NO_PROXY='*127.0.0.1:12557'
export NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=${HOME}/.speedscale/certs/tls.crt
```

Once that's done you are going to restart the application:

```
npm start
```

Now you're going to send the same test transactions, but the inbound port has changed to `4143`:

```
export PORT=4143
curl http://localhost:$PORT/
curl http://localhost:$PORT/nasa
curl http://localhost:$PORT/events
curl http://localhost:$PORT/bin
```

As this is running you should get proper responses from the application, and you should also see the data in Speedscale traffic viewer.

## Replay

The first step to replay is to [create a snapshot](https://docs.speedscale.com/guides/creating-a-snapshot/). You should see the data like this in your traffic viewer:

![traffic-viewer](/img/spd-traffic-viewer.png)

The next step is to `Save Tests/Mocks` and follow the workflow using all the default values. The result should be a snapshot that looks like so:

![snapshot](/img/spd-snapshot.png)

Now you are going to replay that snapshot on your own machine using `speedctl`. Note that this example uses the `standard` [test config](https://docs.speedscale.com/guides/replay/config/) you can make your own for a variety of different kinds of tests!

Note that this command will:
* Run the service mocks on port `4140`
* Send calls to your app on port `3000`

```
export SNAPSHOT_ID=MY_SNAPSHOT_ID
speedctl replay \
  $SNAPSHOT_ID \
  --test-config-id standard \
  --http-port 4140 \
  --custom-url http://localhost:3000
```

After running, you should see a Report in the [Speedscale Reports](https://app.speedscale.com/reports) list. It should have an 87.5% success rate like this.

![Speedscale Report](/img/spd-report-summary.png)

The reason for the lower success rate is because the `/` endpoint includes a timestamp, and all the values in the JSON response are being compared. In this case you want to ignore the timestamp and just compare all the other fields.

![Assertion](/img/spd-report-assert.png)

You can customize your test config to ignore the `ts` value. You can test this immediately by hitting the 3 dots in the corner and selecting `Edit Test Config`. Then go to the `Assertions` tab and click on the `HTTP Response Body` assertion and add `ts` to the ignore list and `Save`. Then `Save` the entire test config and your report will be reanalyzed.

![HTTP Response Body](/img/spd-http-response-body.png)

Your report should now show 100% and you can see the `ts` is ignored by opening up the assertion view.

Congrats, you completed all the capture and replay steps locally! Now is a great time to explore and check out other ways to run your tests for load, contract validation, chaos, or even start to integrate this into your CI/CD workflow.
